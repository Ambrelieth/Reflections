1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A respository creates a hidden file that will contain the metadata and
    history of commits made. The computer needs a place to store this that will
    be associated with the files that are a part of the reposistory.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area allows control over which files need to be tracked for a given
    change. If no changes were made to a file, that file doesn't need to be tracked for
    that commit. Some files may not be changed at all after the initial commit.  Be
    careful, though. A commit is asnapshot of the current files, and the changes made
    to them, not the files you plan to change.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    Changes between the working directory files and the last commit can be checked against
    those in the staging area to ensure that the changes you want to commit are those
    that will be commited. You can be sure that the file in the staging area is the one
    you want to save.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

    If you want to make a whole new version of the project, a branch can facilitate this.
    It preserves the project up till this point and allows you to access the original project
    at any time. They can also be used to preserve a working copy of the project while different
    branches are used to create new features.
