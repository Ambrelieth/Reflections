What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A respository creates a hidden file that will contain the metadata and
    history of commits made. The computer needs a place to store this that will
    be associated with the files that are a part of the reposistory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area allows control over which files need to be tracked for a given
    change. If no changes were made to a file, that file doesn't need to be tracked for
    that commit. Some files may not be changed at all after the initial commit.  Be
    careful, though. A commit is asnapshot of the current files, and the changes made
    to them, not the files you plan to change.
